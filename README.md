YOUSSEF-DOS kernel - based on FreeDOS 2.43

https://the-youssef-nasr-company.github.io/youssef-dos

The YOUSSEF-DOS kernel implements the core MS/PC-DOS (R) compatible functions.  It is derived from Pat Villani's DOS-C kernel and released under the GPL v2.  Please see https://the-youssef-nasr-company.github.io/youssef-dos for more details about the YOUSSEF-DOS (TM) Project.   This was originally a branch based on 2042 SVN 0xFD kernel; the full svn history has since been added to git (see other branches) and current development of release kernels are available here.  Please fork and submit a Pull Request!

Compiled kernels ready to use (just copy kernel.sys over an existing install) are available at the releases.


This version of the kernel is intended only for 8086+ or 80386+ IBM compatible computers in continuation of the goals of the YOUSSEF-DOS (TM) Project.
